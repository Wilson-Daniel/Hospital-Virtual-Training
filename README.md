# Problem Statement
Medical students have limited opportunities to practice their clinical skills in real hospital settings due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other constraints. This affects their learning outcomes and preparedness for future practice.

# Project Description
Aim: The goal is to create a VR simulation that can help medical students practice their clinical skills in different hospital situations and improve their learning outcomes and readiness for real practice.

Benefits: The VR simulation will enable medical students to experience various hospital settings in a realistic and safe way, without exposing themselves or patients to any infection or harm. The VR simulation will also give them feedback and evaluation on how they did, as well as chances to learn from their mistakes and enhance their skills.

Limitations: The VR simulation should work well with different types of devices and platforms, such as mobile phones, tablets, computers, or headsets. The VR simulation should also be easy to use, interesting, and affordable.

People involved: The main people who are interested in or affected by the VR simulation are medical students, medical teachers, hospital workers, patients, and VR makers.

How to measure success: The effectiveness of the VR simulation can be assessed by the following factors:
- How many medical students use the VR simulation and how happy they are with it.
- How much medical students' clinical knowledge, skills, and attitudes improve after using the VR simulation.
- What medical teachers and hospital workers think about the quality and usefulness of the VR simulation.
- How much the VR simulation saves money and time compared to traditional in-hospital training methods.
